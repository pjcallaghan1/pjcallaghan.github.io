  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <main class="main body">
    <p>My name is Patrick Callaghan, and I'm 22 years old. I was born and raised in Cary, but recently moved to Fuquay-Varina as I continue my academic career at Wake Technical Community College. My family is from New Hampshire and Massachusetts areas, but moved to North Carolina before I was born because of work. Growing up I always enjoyed playing sports and making friends. As I grew older I started to enjoy playing video games to make even more friends and partake in a lot of community activities. </p>
