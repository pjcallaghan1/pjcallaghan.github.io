    <p>This page will include a insight on what I enjoy to do outside of academic and workplace enviroments. The things included will allow the viewer to get to know me better than just someone trying to show what I could provide in a workplace, but also connections to some things that they or others around them might enjoy. I will highlight why I like the things I do and how I got into liking these things.</p>
